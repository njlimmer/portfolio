<h1>Portfolio for Nancy Limmer</h1>

<h2>This is my portfolio project for freecodecamp.com.</h2>

I am currently a junior high librarian who is teaching herself to code.  I am doing this because learning is fun, I have a coding club at my school, and because I may not always be a librarian!

I am planning to use HTML, CSS, and some JS.

This is definitely a work in progress.
